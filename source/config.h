/* Round 152: 192 -> 896 MB. The r151 log finally produced the failure this
 * comment has predicted for dozens of rounds, with the exact recorded
 * signature:
 *
 *   [oc] ARMED: window 704 MB          <- only 704 this boot; 1152-1600 in others
 *   [mem] arena 81% reserved (157 of 192 MB)
 *   [mmap] OC window full for 319 MB -> heap-backed arena
 *   [mmap] arena full -> newlib fallback (#1) -- memory pressure
 *   [mmap] 127 MB (prot=0x0 anon=1) -> 0x0     <- mmap returned NULL
 *   [mmap] arena full -> newlib fallback (#2) -- memory pressure
 *   -> crash in libunity
 *
 * "couldn't fit a 127MB OC-window overflow -> mmap NULL -> Unity crash" is
 * word for word what 512 MB did. We were running 192.
 *
 * It also explains the intermittency: the OC window is clamped to the largest
 * stack-region hole, which is different every boot (704 MB here, 1152-1600 in
 * runs that were fine). A big window absorbs the spill; a small one pushes it
 * into this arena, which at 192 MB could not take it. "A couple of perfect runs
 * then a crash" is that lottery.
 *
 * 896 is the value this comment has recommended all along = 1.75x the 512 fail
 * point. Anything at or below 512 is KNOWN to fail -- do not "compromise" at
 * 400. Paid for by right-sizing OC_POOL_BYTES below. */
/* ROUND ABR-2: 896 -> 640 MB, to fund GPUA_BYTES back up to 1152.
 * The long comment above is Fruit Ninja's history and warns that <=512 is
 * KNOWN to fail there. 640 stays above that line. Justification for moving it
 * at all: across a full Angry Birds run that reached the in-game HUD and 857
 * rendered frames, this arena logged ZERO pressure -- not one "arena full" or
 * "newlib fallback" line -- while the GPU arena hit its ceiling and started
 * failing 64 MB allocations. Memory is being held where it is not needed and
 * starved where it is. Shrinking this arena feeds the newlib heap directly
 * (main.c: fake_heap_size = size - so_zone - arena_sz - big_align), which is
 * where both GPUA_BYTES and OC_POOL_BYTES are drawn from.
 * If "[mmap] arena full -> newlib fallback" ever appears, put this back. */
/* ABR round 5: BACK TO 640. Round 4 took this to 512 on the argument that it
 * had "logged zero pressure". That argument was wrong, and the FN history above
 * was right: the failure mode of an undersized mmap arena is NOT an "arena
 * full" log line, it is an mmap returning NULL that Unity mishandles, and it is
 * INTERMITTENT because the OC window is clamped to the largest stack-region
 * hole, which differs every boot. Exactly as the comment predicts, five boots
 * at 512 gave three hard hangs with the GPU arena never even initialised and
 * two runs that managed 42 frames. 640 is the value that last reached actual
 * gameplay. Absence of a log line is not evidence of absence. */

#define OC_WINDOW_BYTES     ((size_t)2048 * 1024 * 1024)  // 32x64MB cheap PROT_NONE reservation. Was 1536; the window-finder clamps to the largest stack-region hole (min(this, hole)), so raising the cap lets a run use its full hole and spill fewer reservations into the (real-memory) arena.
// Commit-pool: real memory backing touched pages of the OC window. Unity is told it
// has 512 MB (libc_shim.c __sysconf PHYS_PAGES + dalvik.vm.heapsize), and it reserves
// its heaps as big PROT_NONE regions that route here, so this pool must be able to
// back the full 512 MB Unity believes it has -- at 256 MB the scene load exhausted it
// (~270 MB working set) and the next uncommitted page faulted -> hard OOM crash.
// malloc. UPDATE 2: trimming the pool 1280->1024 + arena 1024->512 fixed the malloc
// OOM (malloc 1409 -> game pushed past the null-buffer crash) but 512 starved the
// arena (see above). That round settled on pool 896 + arena 896 + malloc 1153.
//
// UPDATE 3 (round 107): those last two no longer describe the tree. The ACTUAL
// values are pool 512 and MMAP_ARENA_RESERVE 896 as of round 152. (Between
// r107 and r152 they were pool 1024 / arena 192, and neither comment said so --
// the recorded "balance" was fiction for 45 rounds. It is accurate again now.) Against the observed 2752 MB newlib heap that gives
// pool 1024 + arena 192 + so_region 160 = 1376 MB, leaving ~1376 MB for malloc.
// Known failure points, for reference when one of these OOMs again:
//   pool live 551 | arena fail 512 | malloc fail 641
// Note the arena is now BELOW its recorded failure point. It has been booting, so
// the enlarged OC window is evidently absorbing what used to spill there, but it
// is the next thing to look at if an allocation failure shows up in the arena.
// RAISED 896 -> 1024 (round 107). Fruit Ninja's live footprint is not PvZ's --
// 244 MB observed at ModeSelect here, but the out-of-memory crash happened later,
// in play, and this is the pool that has to absorb it. +128 MB comes out of the
// plain-malloc share, which currently sits ~1376 MB against a recorded failure
// point of 641 MB, so there is room to give.
//
// Safe to raise now: main.c retries in 128 MB steps down to OC_POOL_MIN_BYTES if
// the allocation does not fit, and logs what it settled on. Previously a pool
// that was too big meant OC DISABLED and a dead boot, which is why this number
// had not been touched.
/* Round 152: 1024 -> 512 MB, to pay for the arena above without asking newlib
 * for more in total. 512 is this comment's own documented floor -- "must be
 * able to back the full 512 MB Unity believes it has" -- and the r151 session
 * peaked at `[oc] committed 235 MB (pool 235/1024)`, so it never used even half
 * of 512. The pool was over-reserved by ~4x while the arena starved.
 *
 * Budget against the observed 2752 MB newlib heap:
 *     before  pool 1024 + arena 192 = 1216   -> malloc ~1536, arena OOM'd
 *     after   pool  512 + arena 896 = 1408   -> malloc ~1344, still above the
 *                                               1153 the history settled on
 * If a scene ever pushes the pool past 512 the symptom is a hard OOM on an
 * uncommitted page (see above), and the fix is to take it back off the arena. */
/* ROUND ABR-1: 512 -> 768 MB. This is the failure the comment above predicts,
 * observed on Angry Birds Reloaded's first scene load:
 *
 *   [oc] committed 512 MB (pool 512/512 MB, recycled 0 MB free)
 *   [oc] commit-pool EXHAUSTED: needed 640 pages (live 512 MB of 512 MB pool)
 *   [xd] pc=libunity+0x71d0d0 far=0x2f57ffffe0 esr=92000046  (WRITE, unmapped)
 *
 * The pool climbed monotonically to 512 and died still climbing, so 512 is a
 * floor, not a peak -- 768 gives 50% headroom. Nothing else was under pressure
 * in that run: zero arena-full lines and zero malloc failures, so this is NOT
 * paid for out of MMAP_ARENA_RESERVE (which the comment above says must stay
 * above 512). It is paid for out of the GPU arena, which is sized 1152 MB from
 * FRUIT NINJA's measurements and has never been measured for this game -- see
 * GPUA_BYTES in nx_alloc.c. The OC pool is allocated in main.c BEFORE
 * gpua_init() runs lazily at first GPU use, and gpua has its own shrink ladder,
 * so the GPU arena absorbs whatever is left rather than failing outright. */
/* ABR round 7: 704 -> 640 MB. The r6 crash was plain-heap starvation:
 * GPUA=1280 + OC=704 left only ~320 MB of the measured 2304 MB newlib heap,
 * followed by `memalign FAILED size=4 KB` and an uncaught std::bad_alloc.
 * The same run consumed 552 MB of this pool; the longest prior run reached
 * 611/768 MB allocated (545 MB live + 65 MB recyclable), so 640 preserves the

/* ORIENTATION -- UNRESOLVED, AND YOU MUST CHECK THIS BEFORE FIRST BOOT.
 *
 * PvZ removed the base's TATE/portrait path because that game is landscape-only.
 * We have NOT confirmed Fruit Ninja's orientation: its managed code contains no
 * ScreenOrientation manipulation and no landscape/portrait strings, so the APK's
 * AndroidManifest.xml (android:screenOrientation) is authoritative. Check it.
 *
 *   landscape -> nothing to do; this build matches PvZ and is correct as-is.
 *   portrait  -> you must restore the Zookeeper TATE compositor-rotation path,
 *                AND revisit nx_pointer, which maps the touch panel to render
 *                space with a straight stretch and applies no rotation. Aiming
 *                will be wrong otherwise -- silently, which is the worst kind.
 *
 * The `portrait` knob is retired here only because it is retired upstream; it
 * is NOT a statement that this game is landscape.                          */
