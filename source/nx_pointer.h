/* nx_pointer.h -- reusable pointer input + on-screen cursor for Switch ports of
 * Android games.
 *
 * Self-contained: owns the pad, the touchscreen, a USB mouse, a stick-driven
 * virtual cursor, and the GL overlay that draws it. Drop nx_pointer.{c,h} into
 * any so-loader style port, call nxp_init() once, nxp_update() per frame,
 * nxp_poll() to drain events, and nxp_draw() right before eglSwapBuffers().
 *
 * Controls
 * --------
 *   Touchscreen  handheld only, always live
 *   '+'          toggle the cursor on / off   (handheld and docked)
 *   '-'          toggle GYRO pointing on / off
 *   Left stick   move the cursor
 *   L / R        recenter the cursor to the middle of the screen (aids gyro)
 *   A / ZR / ZL  tap / confirm at the cursor (ZL/ZR = one-handed play)
 *   D-pad U/D    decrease / increase sensitivity -- applies to whichever device
 *                is ACTUALLY driving the cursor: mouse if one is plugged in,
 *                else gyro if active, else the stick. One control, one job; it
 *                never tunes a device that isn't there.
 *   USB mouse    moves the cursor (handheld or docked); left button taps; the
 *                wheel adjusts sensitivity where the HID layer reports it.
 *   Gyro         tilt/turn the controller to point. Yaw moves X, pitch moves Y.
 *                A connected mouse takes priority: gyro is switched off while
 *                one is plugged in.
 *
 * Custom cursor
 * -------------
 * <data_dir>/cursor_pointer.png is the normal cursor and
 * <data_dir>/cursor_grab.png is used while click is held. Each may be up to
 * 1024x1024 and keeps its alpha. If the pointer image is missing, a built-in
 * vector arrow is drawn.
 *
 * Settings
 * --------
 * The three sensitivities (stick, mouse, gyro) are loaded from
 * <data_dir>/pointer.cfg at startup and saved back 3 seconds after the last
 * change -- so a burst of D-pad presses costs exactly one write, not twenty.
